=head1 NAME

Muldis::DBP -
Formal spec of an abstract database protocol for Perl 6

=head1 VERSION

This document is Muldis::DBP version 0.1.0.-9 for Perl 6.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

I<This documentation is pending.>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document is the human readable authoritative formal specification of
the B<Muldis DBP> (B<MDBP>) library API for Perl 6.

The fully-qualified name of this document and the library API specification
it contains is C<Muldis_DBP_Perl6 'http://muldis.com' '0.1.0.-9'>.  It is
the official/original (not embraced and extended) Muldis DBP library API
specification by the authority Muldis Data Systems (C<http://muldis.com>),
version number C<0.1.0.-9> (this number matches the VERSION in this file).

The Muldis DBP specification for Perl 6 is expressly designed
to be compatible with the B<Muldis D> language specification (see
L<Muldis::D>), version C<Muldis_D 'http://muldis.com' '0.201.0.-9'> in
particular; however the two are also mutually independent by design.
Iff Perl 6 libraries that implement the MDBP choose to explicitly support
using the Muldis D language with it, then certain parts of the MDBP
specification would apply to them, and otherwise not.

=head1 OVERVIEW

I<This documentation is pending.>

I<TODO: The API details would be described partly in terms of a fake
example Perl 6 library implementing it, where the given example code uses
the regular Perl 6 subroutine signature syntax and which uses lots of the
"..." yada-yada syntax.>

I<Conforming to this API doesn't preclude the implementer from providing
additional classes and routines, it just requires that a specific subset
exists among those; an implementer can add proprietary features that may create
lock-in if used, but if users stick to what the API mandates then they shouldn't
be (as) locked-in.>

=head1 VERSIONING

I<This documentation is pending.>

=head1 SEE ALSO

The separate all-documentation distribution L<Muldis::D> is the formal
specification of the B<Muldis D> language and its intended operating
environment, which the Muldis::DBP API specification is
co-developed with and designed to be compatible with.

These existing or prospective Perl 6 libraries implement at least 1 version
of the B<Muldis DBP> API: L<Muldis::D::Ref_Eng>, and so on.

The word MULDIS is intended to be used as the distinguishing brand name for
all the products and services of Muldis Data Systems.  So we would greatly
appreciate it if in general you do not incorporate the word MULDIS into the
name or logo of your website, business, product or service, but rather use
your own distinct name (exceptions appear below).  It is, however, always
okay to use the word MULDIS only in descriptions of your website, business,
product or service to provide accurate information to the public about
yourself.

If you do incorporate the word MULDIS into your names anyway, either
because you have permission from us or you have some other good reason,
then:  You must make clear that you are not Muldis Data Systems and that
you do not represent Muldis Data Systems.  A simple or conspicuous
disclaimer on your home page and product or service documentation is an
excellent way of doing that.

=item Brock Wilcox (C<awwaiid@thelackthereof.org>)

On 2016.12.08, suggested a new list of candidate names for this project
such that one of those, B<DBP> for I<DataBase Protocol>, was adopted as of
2016.12.09 for this project's working name, prefixed with B<Muldis>.

=head1 FORUMS

Several public email-based forums exist whose main topic is
the L<Muldis D|Muldis::D> language and its implementations, especially
the L<Muldis::D::Ref_Eng> reference implementation, but also
the L<Set::Relation> module.  They exist so that users of Muldis D or
Muldis::D::Ref_Eng can help each other, or so that help coming from the
projects' developers can be said once to many people, rather than
necessarily to each individually.  All of these you can reach via
L<http://mm.darrenduncan.net/mailman/listinfo>; go there to manage your
subscriptions to, or view the archives of, the following:

=over

=item C<muldis-db-announce@mm.darrenduncan.net>

This low-volume list is mainly for official announcements from Muldis D
language or implementation developers, though developers of related projects
can also post their announcements here.  This is not a discussion list.

=item C<muldis-db-users@mm.darrenduncan.net>

This list is for general discussion among people who are using Muldis D or
any of its implementations, especially the Muldis::D::Ref_Eng reference
implementation.  This is the best place to ask for basic help in getting
Muldis::D::Ref_Eng installed on your machine or to make it do what you want.
If you are in doubt on which list to use, then use this one by default.
You could also submit feature requests for Muldis D projects or report
perceived bugs here, if you don't want to use CPAN's RT system.

=item C<muldis-d-language@mm.darrenduncan.net>

This list is mainly for discussion among people who are designing the
Muldis D language specification, or who are implementing or adapting Muldis
D in some form, or who are writing Muldis D documentation, tests, or
examples.  It is not the main forum for any Muldis D implementations, nor
is it the place for non-implementers to get help in using said.

=item C<muldis-db-devel@mm.darrenduncan.net>

This list is for discussion among people who are designing or implementing
Muldis::D::Ref_Eng, or other Muldis D implementations,
or who are writing Muldis::D::Ref_Eng core documentation,
tests, or examples.  It is not the main forum for the Muldis D language
itself, nor is it the place for non-implementers to get help in using said.

=back

An official IRC channel for Muldis D and its implementations is also
intended, but not yet started.

Alternately, you can purchase more advanced commercial support for various
Muldis D implementations, particularly Muldis::D::Ref_Eng, from its author by
way of Muldis Data Systems; see L<http://www.muldis.com/> for details.
